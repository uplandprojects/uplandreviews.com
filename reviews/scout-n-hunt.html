									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										It's hard to imagine what scouting and hunting was like before using these
										hunting maps. We used to spend hours looking through state maps and marking
										pins on Google. With the Scout-N-Hunt you can easily identify land
										boundaries and habitat directly from a cell phone, tablet or computer. Spend
										more time chasing birds and less time scouting for spots.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Finding the right cover</strong> These maps make it extremely easy to
										find the cover your are looking for. From aspen cuts for ruffed
										grouse and woodcock, to PLOTS access and crop data for pheasant. Everything is
										clearly marked so you you know exactly what to expect before your hunt.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Multiple states</strong>
										If you like to hunt more than one state during the season, we recommend that you
										get the <a
											href="https://mobilehuntingmaps.com/category/all-mobile-maps-bird-bundle/"
											target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">all state bundle</a>. This gives you
										access to 12 states for Grouse & Woodcock and 5 state maps of Pheasant, Quail,
										Sharp-tails, Huns, and Chukar. With
										more states coming online in 2020. We went on our first ND pheasant hunt last
										year. Other members of our party spent hours sifting through maps online,
										printing them out, and marking them with up with colored pencils. Never once did
										we look at them. Instead we downloaded the state of ND and had all the
										information we needed on our phone.
										<br><br>
										<strong>Offline</strong> Chasing birds usually means limited cell service. The
										beauty of these maps is internet access is not needed once you download and
										install them to your device. The downside though is they do take up a little
										extra storage space. But that shouldn't be a problem for most modern phone
										owners.
										<br><br>
										<strong>Accuracy</strong> For the most part the cut and crop data is
										accurate. Although it is rare, we do find a few spots each year where the
										habitat does not match what is labeled on the map. It's not overly surprising
										since the data comes from the state. Just report the issue back to the
										Scout-N-Hunt team so they can go back and review the data.
										<br><br>
										One of the neat things when using the mobile hunting maps, is you find a lot of
										new spots you wouldn't otherwise know about. It forces you to get out and try
										new areas instead of hunting the same zones repeatedly throughout the season.
