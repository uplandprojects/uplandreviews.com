										All the standard features of our current best selling R.A.P.T. 1400 training
										collar, now with a beeper function.The revolutionary new R.A.P.T. 1450 Upland
										remote dog trainer features a curved transmitter design with a strap for
										multiple grip positions. The Rapid Access button provides quick corrections and
										is programmable for all collar functions (Nick, Continuous, and Beeper modes).
										The collar is waterproof, rechargeable, and fits small to large dogs. The
										transmitter FLOATS on water.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										<strong>Beeper:</strong> The beeper features are a nice alternative to running
										your dog with a bell. Especially when hunting thick cover. The run point option
										gives a continuous beep to keep in constant contact. The point beeper seems to
										be accurate and works well to indicate when your dog goes on point. I personally
										get the most use out of the beep locator. Even with a bell on, when I am in
										thick cover, it is hard to tell where my dog is. The manual beep is an easy way
										to locate her.
										<br /><br />
										There are a couple minor issues we found with the unit's beeper. First, it is
										wicked loud. To be fair loud is needed if your dog is off in the distance and
										past normal range. The unit does come with a <a
											href="https://dtsystems.com/products/parts-accessories/remote-trainer-parts/rapt-1450-upland-parts/beeper-horn-cover-for-rapt-1450-h20-1850-spt-2430.html"
											target="_new">beep horn cover</a> to help reduce the volume output.
										Unfortunately, the cap fell off the first day. Second, all three beeper modes
										run off the same button on the transmitter. That button can be sensitive. There
										have been many times I have had to re-cycle through the different modes to reset
										it to the desired state.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Transmitter:</strong> D.T. Systems has a unique design for all of its
										RAPT models. It's designed to fit over the top of your hand so that you can keep
										both hands on your shotgun.
										<br />
										<img src="../assets/images/reviews/dtsystems-rapt150-transmitter-1.png" />
										<br /><br />
										This unique design does create a couple of challenges. For starters, the only
										button that is accessible for your thumb is the quick access button. One great
										feature of the transmitter is you can program this "nick" button to any of the
										other settings. Nick (default), continuous, vibrate, or beeper can all be
										programmed to be used on the quick access button. However this still posses
										challenges if you need to use a different mode. It takes two hands and
										additional time get the device off your hand and positioned to place where those
										buttons are accessible. This can be even more exciting with gloves on when it is
										20 degrees. The design also makes having the transmitter on a tether around your
										neck a little awkward. It's bulky and bounces around as you walk. It also
										doesn't fit the standard transmitter holders in any of the noteable upland
										vests.
										<br /><br />
										One observation we noticed was a periodic delay in response. Many times in the
										field I would press the beep locator and waited a half second or more before I
										could hear it. This does not always happen. In fact, the collar works as
										designed most of the time. That said, it happens enough to notice. With an
										e-collar, I need an immediate response every time. I want to know that I can
										depend on it.
