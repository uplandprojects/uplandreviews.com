										When we, as upland hunters, think of gear reviews we immediately envision guns,
										vests, electronic collars, boots, and all the other gadgets that make days
										afield with our four-legged friends more enjoyable. We recall the times when a
										blackberry bush made us reconsider our clothing choice, when a too-hot-to-handle
										9 month old pup sent us shopping for a GPS collar, or when summer training
										routines had us considering which brand of bird launcher to invest in. The
										meticulous planning that precludes a successful fall is a year-round exercise
										that for many has become a way of life. Not unlike other equipment, training
										books and manuals hold a special place in the lives of upland hunters. While a
										hunting vest impacts our time in the field, training books can impact the larger
										portion of our life: time not in the field.
										<br /><br />
										Most people in the upland hunting world have heard of the Smith family; the
										legacy of Delmar, Rick, Ronnie, and other Smiths penetrates hunting circles
										across the country. From East to West there are amateur and professional
										handlers watching “The Silent Command System” DVDs, attending seminars, and
										reading <a
											href="https://www.ronniesmithkennels.com/store/bird-dog-training-book/"
											target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Training Bird Dogs with Ronnie Smith
											Kennels</a>. As a unique blend of art
										and knowledge, the book is extremely detailed and covers the progressive
										training method the Smiths have been perfecting since the 1950s.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										<strong>Quality</strong> Readers will immediately notice the size and quality of
										the hardback book; full
										sized, thick, photo quality paper makes the content in the book stand out from
										the
										crowd. The training method outlined by the book, often called the HuntSmith
										method,
										is a tried and true approach to training a pointing dog. The HuntSmith training
										method is centered around natural animal behavior, body language, and the fact
										that
										dogs don’t speak English/Spanish/French/German/etc. This training method
										develops
										dogs into strong, confident, cooperative, and proficient hunters.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>An Easy Read</strong> A well detailed table of contents lays out the
										structure that takes the reader
										through a brief history of the Smith family of dog trainers, puppy development,
										formal training, and final polishing of a bird dog. The book includes practical,
										real world examples of where trainers often go wrong and actionable tips to
										avoid or
										correct these issues. The glossary at the end makes the book serviceable as a
										field
										guide, however the quality and imagery of the book make it more suitable as a
										coffee
										table staple that is sure to capture the imaginations of hunters and non-hunters
										alike.
										<br /><br />
										<a href="https://www.ronniesmithkennels.com/store/bird-dog-training-book/"
											target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Training Bird Dogs with Ronnie Smith
											Kennels</a> is a must
										have for upland hunters
										who
										like to read or look at awesome pictures. The book is laid out sequentially and
										can
										be used as a quick reference for tackling nearly any training challenge you may
										find. Give this as a gift, buy it for yourself, or both and it will likely be
										the
										staple of a great upland book collection.
