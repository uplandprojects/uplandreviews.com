									<p>
										Last summer, we took out our two GSP's for a
										regular pre-season workout. Fifteen minutes into the outing we flushed a
										covey of Ruffed Grouse. As my attention was focused on our
										13 month old, I noticed the veteran dog was
										nowhere to be seen. We looked for her until dark and came
										back the next morning to continue the search. Several
										hours later she was finally found. It is a horrible
										feeling when your dog goes missing. That day I decided to do
										something about it. I went online, did the research, and
										purchased the
										<a href="https://www.dogtra.com/products/tracking-and-training/pathfinder"
											target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Dogtra Pathfinder</a>.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										<strong>Price Point:</strong> First and foremost, the
										price point for the Pathfinder is what caught my
										attention. The unit costs $399 and includes the GPS Collar
										and Connector. Add on collars for additional dogs cost
										$249. Compare that to other mainline competitors that
										range from $600 to $800 for a single unit. <br /><br />
										<strong>Working with your Phone:</strong> Having the
										Dogtra Pathfinder work directly on your phone is an
										awesome feature but comes with challenges depending on the
										weather conditions. The interface is simple to use making
										it easy to find the location of your dogs. This works
										great when the conditions are warm and dry. When we tried
										using the unit in snow or rain we found it more difficult
										to use. Operating an iPhone in adverse conditions causes
										the thumbprint scanner and touch screen to be
										temperamental. Making it frustrating when you need quick
										access to the beep or stimulate commands. <br /><br />
										We also noticed that we needed to restart our phone in
										order for the phone to sync properly and find the GPS
										units. This did not happen every time, but it happened
										enough to take notice.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Multiple Dogs:</strong> One of my favorite
										features of the Pathfinder is being able to run multiple
										dogs. I can quickly see where my dogs are located and
										switch between them to beep or make a correction. As a
										bonus I can track where both dogs have already been.
										Making it easier to walk new ground and not re-trace areas
										we already covered. <br /><br />
										<strong>Small Delay:</strong> There is a small delay when
										using this collar for corrections. It didn't cause any
										problems when working in the field. But during training
										sessions, a delay is not acceptable. We reverted back to a
										regular e-collar for yard and training work. <br /><br />
										<strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> The strength of the Dogtra
										Pathfinder is it's GPS tracking ability. It provides you
										the peace of mind knowing that you can always find your
										dog. Although it has both beep and stimulation features,
										we don't recommend using it as a training collar. The
										units stimulation has a short delay from when your finger
										taps the phone until it reaches the receiver. You risk
										having the stimulation confuse your dog. Consider using
										training collar instead. <br /><br />
										Not having the handheld unit on a leash around your neck
										is an inconvenience. I use the beep as a correction
										command for my dogs. So when I am in the field, I don't
										want to be fishing in my pockets for my phone. I need to
										be hands free with quick access to make those necessary
										corrections.

												Good GPS unit but not recommended for training

												We recommend to the
												<a href="https://www.dogtra.com/products/tracking-and-training/pathfinder"
													target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Dogtra Pathfinder</a>
												to anyone who desires a GPS tracking collar. It is
												priced right and has all the major features you would
												expect in a tracking unit. Although it is not ideal
												for day to day training, it provides that much needed
												peace of mind when out in the field.
