                                            target="_new" style="color: #ED7014">Q5 Centerfire Upland Bird Vest</a> is probably the most
                                        well-made vest we have seen. Constructed from extremely durable materials and
                                        yet light enough to be worn all day long. One of the more intriguing features of
                                        the product is the ability to swap out accessories and customize the vest to fit
                                        your needs. You can acquire and remove attachments such as pouches and water
                                        bottle holders in minutes. In fact, during our early season training routine we
                                        quickly realized that the external front pouches were not needed. In just a
                                        couple minutes we removed them resulting in an ultra-lite vest for early season
                                        dog training. This kind of flexibility lets you create the ideal vest for every
                                        kind of upland hunting situation.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        We couldnâ€™t find much wrong with the Q5 Centerfire, except because of its
                                        durability, the vest was a little stiff with the front pouches still installed.
                                        They tended to rub on our font legs as we crouched down and moved through the
                                        grouse woods. However, with the pouches removed, the Q5 performed extremely
                                        well. In our opinion this vest is optimized for the open country. But with
                                        some adjustments it can still be used in thicker cover.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        All in all this is a mighty nice vest that is made to last. With the option add
                                        and remove accessories, the Q5 Centerfire gives you the opportunity to create
                                        the perfect for every upland situation.

                                    <h4>What we found</h4>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Quality:</strong>
                                        This vest is well made and comfortable. Comes standard with extra padding for
                                        comfort around neck and upper back. Back is solid to avoid snagging while the
                                        inner portion is mesh for maximumn ventilation. It has a padded hip-belt system
                                        with lumbar support for effective weight distribution and puts load on the hips,
                                        freeing your upper body for unrestricted movement.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        <strong>Adjustable:</strong> One thing you will notice with the Q5 product is
                                        everything is adjustable and customizable. You can add and remove pouches and
                                        compartments at will. This is allows you to adjust to the type of hunting and
                                        terrain. The downside with this setup is there is little room for accessory
                                        compartments that come standard. We would have loved to see some more D-rings
                                        and pockets without having to purchase additional accessories.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        <strong>Made for open country:</strong>
                                        If you are hunting the open country of the western plains, the Q5 is the perfect
                                        vest for you. Plenty of storage and lightweight to go all day long. If you hunt
                                        the grouse woods of the midwest, we recommend you keep the customizations and
                                        compartments to a minumum. We found the more accessories you have the more
                                        constricting and bulky the Q5 becomes. Making it hard to navigate thick cover.
                                        Once we removed those extra pouches, we had no problem getting around.

                                                    one or both pouches. It makes it easier to bend down or crawling over

                                                The inside of the bird pouch contains a pocket on each side. Making it ideal
