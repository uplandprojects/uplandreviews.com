									<h4>About the Product</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										Branded as the world’s first fully customizable front-loading upland hunting
										vest. It is fully adjustable and customizable to fit your hunting style. Just
										about everything on the Over/Under vest can be taken off or adjusted. Depending
										on how and where you hunt, you can either keep the vest streamlined and thin, or
										load it up with add-on's. These include two different ammo pouches, water bottle
										holder, electronics pouch, water blatter, and a gun stock rest.
										<br /><br />
										All vests are meticulously crafted using
										1000D CORDURA®, Hypalon and leather accents, rip-stop liners and every detail is
										stitched to perfection.
										<br /><br />
										Vests and accessories can be ordered directly from the <a
											href="https://chiefupland.com/" target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Chief
											Upland website</a>.

									<h4>Our Review Process</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										The first thing we noticed about this vest was the low profile. Unlike most
										other vests, it fits close to the body with an athletic style feel to it. We
										think this great when the weather is nice, but we are unsure how the vest might
										fit when we get bundled up for the cold weather season. So we decided to break
										up our review in two parts. One for the early and mid-season, and another for
										the late season. In this review, we will focus on how the vest performs in
										warmer weather.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />

									<p>
										<strong>Quality:</strong> The first thing you will notice is about this vest is
										the unmatched quality. The stitching and materials are made to last season after
										season. You can tell that every inch of this vest has been planned out to ensure
										maximum comfort, durability, and the ability to customize are achieved. We have
										tested a lot of vests,
										the <a href="https://chiefupland.com/" target="_new"
											style="color: #ed7014;">Chief
											Upland website Over/Under</a> is by far the highest quality vest we have
										seen in
										it's price range.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Setup:</strong> Don't expect this vest to work for you right out of the
										box. The vest won't fit right without making alterations and adjustments. It
										requires some setup to make sure it fits your body type and
										preferences. It's worth taking the time and getting right.
										<a href="#" data-toggle="modal" style="color: #ed7014;"
											data-target="#tipsModal">
											Here are some tips
										</a> to get you started. You can also watch <a
											href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmr72173WRI" target="new"
											style="color: #ed7014;">this video</a> on the Chief Upland YouTube channel.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Fit and feel:</strong> We do suggest that, unless you
										are going to specifically launch pheasants, you should go
										with the BL 509 series. The BL 709 is too much launcher
										for anything smaller. It becomes heavy to hall around the
										in the field. It's larger size also makes it difficult to
										hide in thin to moderate cover. The BL 509 is the right choice for most training
										situations.<br /><br />
										<strong>Accessories:</strong> Our favorite feature with these launchers is how
										easy they are to load. The "easy-load" system provides an easy access door that
										is used to slip the bird into the launcher after it has been set. With the
										safety pin in place, you never have to worry about an accidental
										release.<br><br>That
										said the safety pin is secured by a small lightweight chain that tends to break
										easily. Sadly ours disappeared after only a couple weeks of use. We recommend
										securing
										it with something stronger than what is provided.
										<br /><br />

					<div class="modal-body"><strong>Chest Straps:</strong> The vest comes with two pairs (short & long).
						Use 1-2 straps
						depending on your needs, definitely not all 4. All 4 were just pre-installed for packaging
						purposes. Move/remove these as needed to find your comfort zone. Most people prefer one or two
						chest straps.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Shoulder Straps:</strong> You can move the attachment point on your hips. You don’t want
						it too far back
						that the shoulder straps are in your armpits. Find what’s comfortable. If you have the weight
						carrying properly on your hips, the shoulder straps almost just float along.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Waist Strap:</strong> Choose the higher or lower tunnel for the waist belt, depending on
						your height. Ideally, you want the waist belt running close to your navel. This helps the weight
						to carry on your hips, not your thighs or your shoulders. Some people still prefer the belt on
						their waist line which is fine too if that’s your comfort preference, this can be ok on shorter
						hunts, but on longer hunts this can fatigue your shoulders/thighs more.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Game bag/MOLLE panels:</strong> There is a small clip on the inside of the game bag on
						each hip. Clip the outer panel to the inner panel. This helps support the weight of the ammo
						attachments when full. Unclip it to font-load a bird, then clip it back on after loading a bird.
						The clip can also be moved forward or back, depending on where you place your attachments (if
						the weight is further forward or back).
