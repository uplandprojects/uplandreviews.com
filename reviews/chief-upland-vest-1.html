									<h4>About the Product</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										Branded as the world’s first fully customizable front-loading upland hunting
										vest. It is fully adjustable and customizable to fit your hunting style. Just
										about everything on the Over/Under vest can be taken off or adjusted. Depending
										on how and where you hunt, you can either keep the vest streamlined and thin, or
										load it up with add-on's. These include two different ammo pouches, water bottle
										holder, electronics pouch, water blatter, and a gun stock rest.
										<br /><br />
										All vests are meticulously crafted using
										1000D CORDURA®, Hypalon and leather accents, rip-stop liners and every detail is
										stitched to perfection.
										<br /><br />
										Vests and accessories can be ordered directly from the <a
											href="https://chiefupland.com/" target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Chief
											Upland website</a>.

									<h4>Our Review Process</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										The first thing we noticed about this vest was the low profile. Unlike most
										other vests, it fits close to the body with an athletic style feel to it. We
										think this great when the weather is nice, but we are unsure how the vest might
										fit when we get bundled up for the cold weather season. So we decided to break
										up our review in two parts. One for the early and mid-season, and another for
										the late season. In this review, we will focus on how the vest performs in
										warmer weather.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />

									<p>
										<strong>Quality:</strong> The BL series is a great tool
										for getting young dogs bird exposer while providing a
										controlled environment. Make sure you invest in the remote launcher
										instead of the manual. It provides full control from afar
										allowing you to setup your dog for success.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Setup:</strong> We do suggest that, unless you
										are going to specifically launch pheasants, you should go
										with the BL 509 series. The BL 709 is too much launcher
										for anything smaller. It becomes heavy to hall around the
										in the field. It's larger size also makes it difficult to
										hide in thin to moderate cover. The BL 509 is the right choice for most training
										situations.<br /><br />
										<strong>Fit and Feel:</strong> We do suggest that, unless you
										are going to specifically launch pheasants, you should go
										with the BL 509 series. The BL 709 is too much launcher
										for anything smaller. It becomes heavy to hall around the
										in the field. It's larger size also makes it difficult to
										hide in thin to moderate cover. The BL 509 is the right choice for most training
										situations.<br /><br />
										<strong>Accessories:</strong> Our favorite feature with these launchers is how
										easy they are to load. The "easy-load" system provides an easy access door that
										is used to slip the bird into the launcher after it has been set. With the
										safety pin in place, you never have to worry about an accidental
										release.<br><br>That
										said the safety pin is secured by a small lightweight chain that tends to break
										easily. Sadly ours disappeared after only a couple weeks of use. We recommend
										securing
										it with something stronger than what is provided.
