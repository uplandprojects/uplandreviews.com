									<h4>About the Product</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										Branded as the world’s first fully customizable front-loading upland hunting
										vest. It is completely adjustable and customizable to fit your hunting style.
										Just about everything on the Over/Under vest can be taken off or adjusted.
										Depending
										on how and where you hunt, you can either keep the vest streamlined and thin, or
										load it up with add-on's. These include ammo pouches, water bottle
										holder, electronics pouch, water blatter, and a gun stock rest.
										<br /><br />
										All vests are meticulously crafted using
										1000D CORDURA®, Hypalon and leather accents, rip-stop liners and every detail is
										stitched to perfection.
										<br /><br />
										Vests and accessories can be ordered directly from the <a
											href="https://chiefupland.com/" target="_new" style="color: #ed7014;">Chief
											Upland website</a>.

									<h4>Our Review Process</h4>
									<br />
									<p>
										The first thing we noticed about this vest was the low profile. Unlike most
										other vests, it fits close to the body with an athletic style feel to it. We
										think this great when the weather is nice, but we are unsure how the vest might
										fit when we get bundled up for the cold weather season. So we decided to break
										up our review in two parts. One for when the weather is warm, and another for
										the late cold season. In this review, we will focus on how the vest performs in
										warmer weather.
									</p>

									<h4>What we found</h4>
									<br />

									<p>
										<strong>Quality:</strong> The first thing that caught our eye was
										the unmatched quality. The stitching and materials are made to last season after
										season. You can tell that every inch of this vest has been planned out. It was
										built to ensure
										maximum comfort, durability, and the ability to customize. We have
										tested a lot of vests,
										the <a href="https://chiefupland.com/" target="_new"
											style="color: #ed7014;">Chief
											Upland website Over/Under</a> is by far the highest quality vest we have
										seen in
										it's price range.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Setup:</strong> Don't expect this vest to work for you right out of the
										box. The vest won't fit right without making alterations and adjustments. It
										requires some setup time to make sure it fits your body type and
										preferences. It's worth taking the time and getting right.
										<a href="#" data-toggle="modal" style="color: #ed7014;"
											data-target="#tipsModal">
											Here are some tips
										</a> to get you started. You can also watch <a
											href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmr72173WRI" target="new"
											style="color: #ed7014;">this video</a> on the Chief Upland YouTube channel.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Fit and feel:</strong> This vest fits differently compared to the others
										on the market. It has a slim profile and sits close to body. This athletic
										outline allows you to move through the north-woods with ease without getting
										hung up on debris. Once you get through the setup, the vest feels like it
										is "floating" on your waste. It also has lots of extra padding on the back
										for maximum comfort.
										<br /><br />
										One flaw with the durable materials, extra back padding, and the
										athletic fit, is it makes this vest a bit uncomfortable on warm days. It
										is not breathable, so expect to sweat more with this vest during the early
										season.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>Accessories:</strong> The Chief Upland Over/Under vest is pretty bare
										bones stock. It comes with a game bag and some small compartments in the back to
										hold a limited amount of gear. To make this vest usable in the field, you are
										going to need at least an ammo pouch. There are multiple accessories to choose
										from between a couple ammo pouches, water bottle holder, electronics pouch, and
										a gun stock rest. All the accessories are made with high quality, just like
										the vest. The vest system allows you to move the pouches around on the vest to
										match your personal hunting style.
										<br /><br />
										Make sure you spend some time getting the accessory pouches setup to where you
										want them. It takes a few tries to get it to feel right.
										<br /><br />
										<strong>The little things:</strong> It's the details of this vest that make it
										special. From the stitching, to the accessories, to the well placed cell phone
										compartment on the chest strap. You can clearly see that a lot of time and
										thought has gone into the design and manufacturing of this vest.

					<div class="modal-body"><strong>Chest Straps:</strong> The vest comes with two pairs (short & long).
						Use 1-2 straps
						depending on your needs, definitely not all 4. All 4 were just pre-installed for packaging
						purposes. Move/remove these as needed to find your comfort zone. Most people prefer one or two
						chest straps.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Shoulder Straps:</strong> You can move the attachment point on your hips. You don’t want
						it too far back
						that the shoulder straps are in your armpits. Find what’s comfortable. If you have the weight
						carrying properly on your hips, the shoulder straps almost just float along.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Waist Strap:</strong> Choose the higher or lower tunnel for the waist belt, depending on
						your height. Ideally, you want the waist belt running close to your navel. This helps the weight
						to carry on your hips, not your thighs or your shoulders. Some people still prefer the belt on
						their waist line which is fine too if that’s your comfort preference, this can be ok on shorter
						hunts, but on longer hunts this can fatigue your shoulders/thighs more.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Game bag/MOLLE panels:</strong> There is a small clip on the inside of the game bag on
						each hip. Clip the outer panel to the inner panel. This helps support the weight of the ammo
						attachments when full. Unclip it to font-load a bird, then clip it back on after loading a bird.
						The clip can also be moved forward or back, depending on where you place your attachments (if
						the weight is further forward or back).
